                Caring for a child with special needs can be rewarding, but it can also be physically and emotionally
                demanding. As a caregiver, you may be so focused on your loved one's needs that you neglect your own
                wellbeing.

              <p>
                Self-care isn't selfishâ€”it's essential. When you take care of your own physical, emotional, and mental
                health, you're better able to provide quality care for your loved one. Think of it like the airplane
                oxygen mask instructions: you need to secure your own mask before helping others.
              </p>

                Caring for a child with special needs can bring up a range of emotions, from joy and love to
